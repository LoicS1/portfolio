          <h5>Narrative</h5>
          <p> As part of the Dublin High Engineering and Design Academy, I had the
          opportunity to attend several field trips. One of the most notable ones
          was a tour of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory environmental 
          remediation site with my mentor Edward Yeh. I was able to examine projects
          Edward was working on, such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon bioremediation
          project, in which specialized bacteria were injected into contaminated 
          groundwater using a special well. I was also able to converse with many
          of Edward's colleagues, who utilized physical models to describe how they
          were cleaning up heavy metals by pumping and filtering groundwater at the
          site. During another field trip, again at the LLNL, I toured Computation
          building. I learned about the arrangement of processors within the 
          supercomputer, as well as the complex cooling system needed to make it
          function. Knowledge of these designs could help me develop new ways to
          address environmental problems in the future.

          At Dublin High, I attended several professional guest speaker presentations.
          Among the most inspiring speakers was Brian Day from the NASA Ames Research
          Center, who described the design of future spaces probes that were to 
          conduct missions to the Sun and Mars.  I was initially intrigued by how
          space probes were designed to avoid cross-contamination between the Earth
          and other celestial bodies, and was surprised when he described that 
          rovers had to avoid certain possibly life-containing areas on Mars. 
          Another speaker who impacted me was Joel Rosales, who works within the
          cybersecurity department of the Air Force. I had always wanted to know 
          how conventional fields of work could be applied to the military, and was
          very interested about the foreign hacking element of his work, and the 
          Air Force ROTC scholarship he described. <!-- second para- meant to refer
          to guest speakers -->

          My mentor was Edward Yeh, a professional environmental engineer at the 
          Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Through Edward, I learned to promote and 
          market myself to potential employers, by practicing and refining skills 
          such as resume tailoring, cover letter writing, and approaching various 
          interview questions. I also learned from him that environmental problems 
          are more complex than they sound- groundwater remediation, for example, 
          uses a lot of unclean energy. I was able to fully test and refine the 
          skills that Edward had taught me by applying for a summer internship 
          with the City of Dublin Public Works Department. I was hired for the 
          position and was able to further hone my communication skills by working 
          with engineers, contractors, city officials, and urban planners on 
          large-scale public transportation projects. Via exposure to different 
          project elements, such as traffic plans and traffic volume surveys, I was
          also able to improve upon my task-managing skills and productivity to 
          successfully meet pressing deadlines. I hope to further enhance these 
          skills with other internships and career opportunities in college.
