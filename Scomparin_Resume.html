        <p> As part of the Dublin High Engineering and Design Academy, I had the opportunity to attend several field trips. One of the most notable ones was a tour of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory environmental remediation site with my mentor Edward Yeh. I was able witness projects Edward was working on, such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon bioremediation project, in which specialized bacteria were injected into contaminated groundwater using a special well. I was also able to converse with many of Edwardâ€™s colleagues, who utilized physical models to describe how they were cleaning up heavy metals by pumping and filtering groundwater at the site. During another field trip, again at the LLNL, I toured Computation building. I learned about the arrangement of processors within the supercomputer, as well as the complex cooling system needed to make it function. Knowledge of these designs could help me develop new ways to address environmental problems in the future.

At Dublin High, I attended several professional guest speaker presentations. Among the most inspiring speakers was Brian Day from the NASA Ames Research Center, who described the design of future spaces probes that were to conduct missions to the Sun and Mars.  I was initially intrigued by how space probes were designed to avoid cross-contamination between the Earth and other celestial bodies, and was surprised when he described that rovers had to avoid certain possibly life-containing areas on Mars. Another speaker who impacted me was ___, who works within the cybersecurity department of the Air Force. I had always wanted to know how conventional fields of work could be applied to the military, and was very interested about the foreign hacking element of his work, and the Air Force ROTC scholarship he described.

 My mentor was Edward Yeh, a professional environmental engineer at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Through Edward, I learned to promote and market myself to potential employers, by practicing and refining skills such as resume tailoring, cover letter writing, and approaching various interview questions. I also learned from him that environmental problems are more complex than they sound- groundwater remediation, for example, uses a lot of unclean energy.
I was able to fully test and refine the skills that Edward had taught me with applying for a summer internship with the City of Dublin Public Works Department. I was hired for the position and was able to further hone my communication skills by working with engineers, contractors, city officials, and urban planners on large-scale transportation related projects. Via exposure to different project elements, such as traffic plans and traffic volume surveys, I was also able to improve upon my task-managing skills and productivity to successfully meet pressing deadlines. I hope to further enhance these skills with other internships and career opportunities in college.
