          May 2016, Introduction to Engineering Design (IED) <!-- Project title,
          class, and date -->
          </h5>
          <p class="card-text">The objective of this project was simple- to design
          a completly new product or a major innovation. My team decided to try to
          solve a well known problem- lack of clean, drinkable water in third-world
          countries. We researched three previous solutions: the solar still, 
          rain/dew collector, and atmospheric water generator (AWG). Afterwards,
          my teammate and I in IED modeled the solution in AutoDesk Inventor, and
          the two teammates in CSP designed a Cloud9 website to highlight the 
          product. Our product is named Aquaharvester and is a combination of 
          the solar still, rain/dew collector, and AWG with some substantial 
          innovations added. It is portable, with a wooden frame mounted on four 
          large, rubber wheels. The solar still is made of solid, durable plastic,
          and features an adjustable height using pegs. The rain/dew collector 
          were improved by using lightweight sheet metal instead of plastic, and
          the addition of a sealed ice container in the center of the metal. We 
          overcame our greatest challenge, cost, by implementing solar panels and
          recycled materials such as a computer fan, water pump, and plastic 
          tubing. I managed the product <a href="Aquaharvester.pdf" target="_blank">documentation</a>,
          <a href="CopyAquaHarvester.pdf" target="_blank">presentation</a>, and 
          team collaboration, and was responsible for creating the improved 
          frame, <a href="fanshell.ipt" target="_blank">AWG fan</a> and rain collector 
          in AutoDesk Inventor. I was able to combine mechanical and environmental
          engineering skills by minimizing energy and material use within the 
          project design, while increasing water output. Our project was successful 
          and earned an A based on the criteria on the project <a href="EntrepreneurRubric.pdf" target="_blank">rubric</a>.
