          <p>The goal of this four-person project was to design a solution to any
          real-world problem. My team decided to build a physical prototype, using
          VEX parts, of a machine that would remove unwanted sediment in reservoirs.
          We had to use lightweight yet strong material, such as steel and titanium 
          for the frame, while designing a net system to pick up sediment, which was
          the most cost efficient system available.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our final solution consisted of a submarine with a rigid, metal exterior 
           frame and central cavity, equipped at the front with wire mesh and light
           sensor at the front opening, and a fine net and metal plates on the rear
           opening. The submarine would patrol the reservoir using its mechanical 
           propellers, and begin filtering sediment in the back net when the light 
           sensor detected the water was murky and full of suspended sediment. 
          </p>
          <p>
          As project leader, I was responsible for managing most of the project 
          <a href="Scomparin_EntrepreneurProject.pdf ">documentation</a>, part of the 
          <a href="SedibotPresentation.pdf">presentation</a>, communicating with my teammates 
          regarding the project design and timeline, and designing the submarine's exterior frame. I 
          learned a lot in my field of interest, environmental engineering, by 
          analyzing how different designs would respond to a complex environmental
          problem (sediment accumulation). However, this project also introduced 
          me to a multi-disciplinary problem-solving approach, as I was also exposed
          to the programming of the sensor and testing of the submarine's mechanical structure.

          <h6>April 2017, Principles of Engineering Design</h6> <!-- Project title,
          class, and date -->
          <p>The objective for this project was to build a machine satisfying an 
          unmet human need, while using VEX robotics hardware, including sensors, 
          as well as the RobotC programming language. My group was asked to find 
          several different winch, pulley, rack and pinion, and drum systems that
          would satisfy the design requirement for our machine. We built an elevator
          that utilized a sensor and button system to pick up people on different 
          floors quickly, as well as come down to the ground floor immediately in 
          case of an emergency such as an earthquake, or when not used for a certain 
          period of time.
          </p>
          <p>
          We used the rack and pinion system as it provided the greatest structural 
          stability for the design; with a gear attached to one side of the elevator,
          the other side was supported by a steel slider. Additionally, we used an ultrasonic
          sensor to measure the height of the elevator to make it stop at the correct 
          floor and bump switches to call the elevator to each floor. During the project,
          I was responsible for the physical design of the elevator using VEX parts, 
          including spacing out the sensors correctly to match input values used in the
          RobotC program, allowing me to work directly with the programmer and the 
          other members of the team working on <a href="Scomparin_MachineControlProject.pdf">documenting</a> the project updates. The
          biggest issue was getting the elevator to move up and down smoothly along 
          the slider- often, the gear would get stuck in the rack because of too much 
          frictional force. This issue was solved by rebuilding the elevator to a new
          size and using more flexible metal parts.
          </p>
          <p>
          This project was eye-opening because I was able to see how mechanics, electronics,
          and programming were combined into one cohesive design. I now have a better
          idea of how to build "smart" systems using sensors and could apply this to
          both the mechanical and environmental fields by designing efficient home 
          energy systems that react to differences in temperature and light.
