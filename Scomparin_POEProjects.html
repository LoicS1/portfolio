          <h6>May 2017, Principles of Engineering Design</h6> <!-- Project title,
          class, and date -->
          <p>The goal of this four- person project was to design a solution to any
          real-world problem. My team decided to build a physical prototype, using
          VEX parts, of a machine that would remove unwanted sediment in reservoirs.
          We had to use lightweight yet strong material, such as steel and titanium 
          for the frame, while designing a net system to pick up sediment, which was
          the most cost efficient option system available.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our final solution consisted of a submarine with a rigid, metal exterior 
           frame and central cavity, equipped at the front with wire mesh and light
           sensor at the front opening, and a fine net and metal plates on the rear
           opening. The submarine would patrol the reservoir using its mechanical 
           propellers, and begin filtering sediment in the back net when the light 
           sensor detected the water was murky and full of suspended sediment. 
          </p>
          <p>
          As project leader, I was responsible for managing most of the project 
          <a href="Scomparin_EntrepreneurProject.pdf">documentation</a>, part of the 
          <a href="SedibotPresentation.pdf">presentation</a>, communicating with my teammates 
          regarding the project design and timeline, and designing the submarine's exterior frame. I 
          learned a lot in my field of interest, environmental engineering, by 
          analyzing how different designs would respond to a complex environmental
          problem (sediment accumulation). However, this project also introduced 
          me to a multi-disciplinary problem-solving approach, as I was also exposed
          to the programming of the sensor and testing of the submarine's mechanical structure.
