        <p class="card-text">Hello! My name is Loic Scomparin, and I am a student currently enrolled in Dublin High School's Engineering and Design Academy. I have always aspired to earn a masters degree in environmental engineering and become a licensed professional environmental engineer. I am specifically interested in managing water resources and taking part in specific bioremediation projects. I’ve always valued the outdoors for its recreational opportunities and health benefits, so it seems natural for me to help ensure that it remains as pristine as possible for future generations to enjoy. Since I’m also highly interested in designing cutting-edge physical innovations, and performing purely scientific environmental research, environmental engineering is very attractive to me. I also appreciate environmental engineering because projects in the field are often complex and require tradeoffs between economic gain and environmental effects. By taking this into account, I know I can effectively design solution systems that will be as useful as possible.
</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, environmental engineering is an extremely broad field, 
requiring knowledge of natural ecology, hydrology, and geology, as well as advanced
design principles and knowledge of human motives and activities. After taking a 
wide variety of science classes, such as biology, chemistry, physics, 
and environmental science, I know I have the inquisitive and persistent attitude
needed to analyze the scientific principles inherent to environmental engineering.
I also possess an innate curiosity towards innovative designs, which I have 
demonstrated by methodically learning about groundwater remediation projects
at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and intrinsically researching topics ranging 
from permeable pavement to the California state water system. In addition to 
possessing the qualities needed in a burgeoning field, I also have the a 
tenacious attitude when it comes to completing paperwork and regulation-heavy 
projects. As a summer intern in my city’s transportation department, I embodied
a strategic approach to ensure that traffic control plans were revised on time. 
Outside of work, I would still define perseverance to be a major theme in my life;
as a cross country runner, I know what it feels like to push through the last 
minutes of a fifteen-mile long run! 
</p>
<p>Based on my education and work experience, I have found even more appreciation towards diligent, goal-oriented work and professional communication. I desire to work to better the future, one step at a time. Pushing the limits of designs and ensuring that they are constantly enhanced appeals to me. Nothing can ever truly be finalized, and I understand that adaptation to new circumstances is key. I’ve also learned that the best projects require effective communications with co workers, but also with people from other companies, in order for everyone to provide the best services possible. 
</p>
 <p> 
Once again, I am a dedicated and passionate individual seeking to better the health of humans and the environment. Thank you for visiting this site, and please feel free to explore my professional and educational background contained within the other pages. Please contact me if you have any questions.
