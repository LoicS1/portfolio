          <h6>March 2019, Computer Science Principles</h6> <!-- Project title,
          class, and date -->
          <p>The objective of this project was to use the object-oriented Python 
          programming language to design a program capable of adding specific features
          to photos. Specifically, the program needed to modify an array of images in 
          approximately the same way to satisfy a client organization's needs, while
          providing a variety of options, including one the user could manipulate. 
          </p>
          <p>
           My partner and I decided to address the issue of water pollution and garbage 
           in the ocean by producing images for an environmental organization 
           <a href="Scomparin_P1.4.7 Image Artist.pdf">(Client #1: a cause)</a>. We selected images showing people and animals
           living in areas with aquatic pollution, then performed operations on 
           the images such as blending two images together, pasting the company's
           logo, pasting meaningful text statements on the images, and adding a
           user-friendly border feature. My specific role in this project was to
           manage the creation of the logo, selection of images, brainstorm design 
           graphics, and write the code to overlay text on the images, while working
           with my partner to test run the program and write <a href="ScomparinP1.4.7 Documentation.pdf">documentation</a> and a 
           <a href="Scomparin_P1.4.7 Image Artist Presenation.pdf">presentation</a>. The main challenge we overcame was organizing our code so
           that a maximum of it could be used on all images at once, which we did
           by sorting code in algorithms that addressed generic and specific manipulations.
           This project was one of my best pieces of work in CSP this year as I
           earned a high grade based on the  <a href="Scomparin_P1.4.7 Rubric.pdf">rubric</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
          This project solidified in knowledge of object-oriented programming,
          including the use of classes, methods, objects, and libraries, as well as
          that of worldwide pollution, which I had touched upon in AP Environmental Science.

          <h5 class="card-text">Scratch Project</h5> 
          <h6>September 2018, Computer Science Principles</h6> <!-- Project title,
          class, and date -->
          <p>The goal of this project was to use the Scratch programming language to 
          develop either an interactive game or story. I created a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/245978400/">story</a> in which the
          main character tried to grow a successful garden. The story included turning 
          points where the user selected an action they wanted the character to perform-
          the result was either failure, success, or moving on to one of two different
          storylines. This was an individual project, so I worked on coding the project
          using Scratch drag and drop programming features, while test running the 
          code and applying my knowledge of basic variable types and <a href="Scomparin_ScratchDoc.pdf">documenting</a> the
          results. The biggest challenge was timing the execution of all the code to
          make the characters seem to move in sync relative to each other, which was
          achieved by careful trial and error and using the broadcasting feature to
          enable character communication.
