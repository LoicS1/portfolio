        <h6>July-August 2018</h6>

          technical knowledge, such as the MUTCD documentation on traffic signs and creating pivot table on cost analyses 
          for construction projects in Excel. As the days and projects passed, I greatly improved my Excel skills and explored
          other Microsoft software like Publisher and Powerpoint. Additionally, I was exposed to... (more coming soon)
