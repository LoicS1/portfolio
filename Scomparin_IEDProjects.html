          <p class="card-text">The objective of this project was simple- to design
          a completly new product or a major innovation. My team decided to try to
          solve a well known problem- lack of clean, drinkable water in third-world
          countries. We researched three previous solutions: the solar still, 
          rain/dew collector, and atmospheric water generator (AWG). Afterwards,
          my teammate and I in IED modeled the solution in AutoDesk Inventor, and
          the two teammates in CSP designed a Cloud9 website to highlight the 
          product. Our product is named Aquaharvester and is a combination of 
          the solar still, rain/dew collector, and AWG with some substantial 
          innovations added. It is portable, with a wooden frame mounted on four 
          large, rubber wheels. The solar still is made of solid, durable plastic,
          and features an adjustable height using pegs. The rain/dew collector 
          were improved by using lightweight sheet metal instead of plastic, and
          the addition of a sealed ice container in the center of the metal. We 
          overcame our greatest challenge, cost, by implementing solar panels and
          recycled materials such as a computer fan, water pump, and plastic 
          tubing. I managed the product <a href="Aquaharvester.pdf" target="_blank">documentation</a>,
          <a href="CopyAquaHarvester.pdf" target="_blank">presentation</a>, and 
          team collaboration. I also designed the improved 
          frame, <a href="fanshell.ipt" target="_blank">AWG fan</a> and rain collector 
          in AutoDesk Inventor. I learned how to combine mechanical and environmental
          engineering skills by minimizing energy and material use within the 
          project design, while increasing water output. Our project was successful 
          and earned an A based on the criteria on the <a href="EntrepreneurRubric.pdf" target="_blank">rubric</a>.

          <p class="card-text">
          The goal of this project was to design a virtual toy train that can be assembled and 
          programmed to run on tracks, in order to boost a toy train company's sales by targeting 
          today's digitized children. The train needed to be interactive to play with and include 
          features that catered to small children. For our project, my group decided to design a 
          classic locomotive with a control car, dining car, and entertainment car. Each car had 
          special features that were constrained into the final assembly, such as a bell on the 
          entertainment car. Throughout the project, I was responsible for designing the 
          entertainment car as collaborating with my team to make the project  <a href="Scomparin_TrainPrez.pdf">presentation </a>. 
          Additionally, I helped make a video of the train running on the tracks and wrote 
          an <a href="Scomparin_Train Project Abstract.pdf">abstract review</a> after the project was completed. Through this project, I 
          developed my understanding of advanced assembly features in Autodesk Inventor, 
          as well as presentation features within the software. Furthermore, I refined my 
          ability to write a clear and concise design brief.
